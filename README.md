# Shinobu

Shinobu is a simple discord bot that can peform simple tasks like playing youtube videos on a voice channel. My plan is to add more features like Dota2 stats, MOTD and random image embed.

# Commands avaible right now

  - !play
  - !leave

# How to run the bot?

  - Clone the repo
  - run `npm install`
  - Follow the `.env.example` to create your `.env`
  - run `npm start`
  - Invite the bot to your server

For steps 3 and 5 I recommend you to visit https://discord.com/developers/applications. Here you will be able to create your invite link and create your auth token.
